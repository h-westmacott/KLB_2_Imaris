# Easy KLB to Imaris conversion

This repo contains a basic python function for converting Keller lab block (KLB) files to Imaris .ims files. 

To use, this repo must be cloned and the required packages must be installed. We recommend creating a new virtual environment for this. 

Once set-up, the repo contains the function `klb_2_ims()` which will covert the supplied .klb file to a .ims file.

Note that work to make this tool easier to use is ongoing!
